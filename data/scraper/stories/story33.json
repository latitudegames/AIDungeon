The fact that we are giving you this advice is as far as we can go without upsetting the balance in the world. In order to avert this war you have to undertake a journey.

Athens is a centre of art and philosophy and houses some of the most beautiful buildings in Greece, while the whole of Sparta is dedicated to the art of warfare, it's houses almost completely devoid of any decorations. While Sparta controls a large part of the Peloponnese it's theatre is smaller than most provincial towns and the city watch is acts ruthlessly against anyone who breaks the law. The Spartans themselves don't even work their own lands, the peoples they conquered have to work for them as semi-slaves.\n\n\nAfter an hour or so of exploring the city you decide to call it a day and enter a tavern.

As you order your drink you can't but help overhear a conversation:\n\n\n'Well, it has been a couple of years since the king died, it's about time she remarried, I mean, she isn't even past childbearing age.'\n\n\n'That's true, but Nelei musn't marry any one of her suitors. She needs a strong husband, one who can resist Akakios. Although Nelei is queen, she is still a woman and as such has nothing to say in politics, and her son has not yet come of age.'\n\n\n'What's wrong with Akakios, he's only a council member isn't he?'\n\n\n'Yes, but one who is bribing about half of the council of elders, and the other half consists of senile old fools.'\n\n\n'And yet most of those councilors are Nelei's suitors.'\n\n\n'Which is exactly my point. Everyone knows Akakios wants to steer towards war with the other city states.'\n\n\n'And why is that such a problem, everyone knows Sparta is the mightiest city state in the whole of Greece?'\n\n\nYour heart is pounding, this is the reason of the civil war, one of the councilors will marry the queen and as a result Sparta will go to war.

She yells to the guard, her hands reveal her anger. The guard looks like he will react, but then he decides to walk back to his post.

He told me a great danger threatened me and my poor son, Kourio. You see, dark clouds are gathering above Sparta. My husband has died, leaving me alone to raise our only child, his heir. I believe he was murdered. You see, the council of elders, the advisors of the king, want us to declare war on the other Greek city states, claiming the supremacy over the whole of Greece. My husband was opposed to this. I believe Akakios, an evil man and the most influential of the elders was behind his assassination. Ever since my husbands death he has tried to persuade me to marry either him or any of the other elders. However, though I am a woman, I am no fool. Akakios wants the sole rulership over Sparta and I think he'll murder me and my son if that is was it takes. I only managed to win some time by telling my suitors I wouldn't be ready to marry anyone until I finish the burial cloth you can see over there. It's meant for my husbands fater, who has fallen gravely ill. The whole day I would work on it, only to undo all that work each night. But now the suitors found out about it and are demanding a marriage.'\n\n\n'That is a sad tale indeed, noble lady, but it does not explain how you knew of my coming.'\n\n\n'My husband told me a messenger was coming, sent by the immortal gods themselves. One who, despite his humble origins, would be able to put a stop to Akakios' malicious plans and bring peace to Sparta. It''s hard to explain, but when I saw you I knew you were the one my dear husband meant.'\n\n\n'You are right, I was sent by the gods to prevent a civil war between the Greek city states. However, I do not have the power, nor the knowledge to interfere in the politics of Sparta.'\n\n\n'Then we'll just have to work together', a youthful voice speaks.\n\n\nYou turn around and see a youth entering the room, about fourteen years you guess.

Kourio, this is the envoy your father told me about.'\n\n\n'Then this must be a sign that we will finally be able to put a halt to the evil plans of Akakios.

Stay true to your heart and refrain from angering the gods and you will reach your destination. In the lands of the Spartans there is a great palace. Is's inhabitant, the great king Agatos, has been betrayed by his courtiers. Now, the flame of war has ignited the hearts of the Spartans, the flame that will engulf the whole of Greece if left unchecked.'\n\n\nThis is what the gods revealed to me. I understand what a terrible burden the gods have placed on your shoulders and I wish I could relieve some of it. My servants will serve you a banquet before you leave, I wish you good luck.'\n\n\nWith these words she retreats into the temple.\n\n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "After the meal you stock up on supplies and set sail towards Sparta...", "result": "Apart from some near-collisions with crocodiles and other inhabitants of the vibrant Nile, your trip back across is rather uneventful.

But then you remember your daunting task, and dark storm clouds gather in your mind.\n\n\nCyrus notices your worried face and approaches you. 'My dear friend, what could possibly be bothering you on such a beautiful day? Like my  dear mother always used to say: 'Life's to short to waste a sunny day. Save your worries for when it rains.' She also had some other sayings, but those are not really appropriate in, well actually all sorts of company.'\n\n\nYour mood instantly brightens, you even manage to produce a smile. Following Cyrus' advice you just fit back and enjoy the voyage.\n\n\n...\n\n\nAs the starry night drives away the shining day, you and the crew go to sleep. Only a few crew members stay on deck to act as sentries. the worries that clouded your mind have not returned. You twist and turn in your sleep as a sense of foreboding doom fills your dreams. You see flashes of images: a beautiful mansion on top of white cliffs, dozens of swines approach you, a bedchamber with a magnificently decorated bed. Then a golden figure approaches and pushes away all other images: Athena, the owl-eyed protector of heroes. 'Brave traveller, noble bard, you're journey has only just begun. Sparta is still far away, but tomorrow you will reach an island, the island of the goddess Circe, the daughter of Helios, the sun-god. You will have to be on your guard, for she is a powerful witch, expect the unexpected and don't lose your objective out of sight: saving Greece from the flames of war.

I cannot guarantee that we are still on the right course. And given the urgency of your 'quest' I am sure you would not have liked it if we suspended our voyage.'\n\n\n'But I'd rather had...'\n\n\n'Yes, I'm sure you had wished the mist wouldn't have set in, but we can't change the past, can we?'\n\n\n'No, but that's not what...'\n\n\n'I thought so, so we'll just sea where the currents take us. Hahaha, sea, get it?'\n\n\nAnd with those wise words he walks away, laughing maniacally to himself.\n\n\nCyrus approaches you with a smirk on his face. 'So you've had a nice chat with our navigator huh. Well, he is a kind of a nutjob, but you won't find a better one in the whole of Greece.' He leaves again, chuckling.\n\n\nAs hours pass, the fog thickens even more and eventually it is impossible to see more than 4 feet ahead of you. Even worse, the ship is mysteriously losing speed. The navigator is walking around like a confused chicken, walking in circles while making strange noises to himself.\n\n\nSuddenly you hear surprised chatter among the crew. Several crew members are pointing at something in the fog. You gaze at the fog but you can't see a thing. But then, just as you are about to turn away you see it: blinking lights pierce through the fog. As if an invisible hand wipes away the fog, it opens up, revealing a green island. What immediately draws your attention is a large house on a hill, gleaming as if made of solid gold.\n\n\nAfter a quick meeting with the crew you decide that, since your ship now has lost all speed, you will all go ashore in dinghies. Of course your curiosity also played a part in this decision.\n\n\n \n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "Continue...", "result": "You feel the familiar feeling of sands shifting beneath your feet as you step out of the dinghy.

The deep blue waves of the sea shape the sand in an elaborate pattern, both beautiful and enigmatic at the same time, much like the rest of the island. You can see a large mansion on top of a low hill about 300 feet inland, surrounded by large gardens. Some distance from the mansion you see some piggeries.As you and your companions walk along the beach you can't help but wonder who lives in such a beautiful place, surely such a place would be fit for one of the inhabitants of the wide skies.\n\n\n The soft sands give way to marble steps, which form a path that leads to the luxurious mansion. Without a single doubt in your mind you climb the steps, determined to meet the inhabitant of such a wondrous place. As you near the mansion you notice that fatigue does not even begun to grip your limbs, nor those of your companions, on the contrary, you feel a blissful sense of joy overcome you as you near the mysterious dwelling. You look at the mansion in more detail. The walls are made of gleaming white marble, decorated with gold and silver fresco's depicting a rural scene: a shepherdess herding groups of animals, like pigs but lions and wolves too. The grand oaken doors are decorated with gold leaf and the silver knockers are shaped like hourglasses.\n\n\nYou are about to grab one of the knockers when the door opens on it's own accord, revealing a beautiful woman. Her beautiful white robe is fastened around her waist with a golden girdle. She wears her golden hair in a long plaited braid and on top of her head she wears a golden circlet. Her face is unfathomable, but her skin is white as milk. She speaks to you and your companions in a voice as sweet as honey: 'Excuse me, noble visitors, but I was not expecting you. May I ask you who you are and why you have come here?'\n\n\nYou answer her: 'noble lady, me and my companions have been traveling far and wide. But the gods have not favored us. The winds, which are sometimes the sailors best friends, but sometimes their enemies, have been absent for a long time and we have not been able to reach our destination. Our supplies have run out and then, like a sign of the gods, we saw your island on the horizon.'\n\n\n'I see... Of course I will give you enough supplies to continue your journey, the gods have not given me riches only to keep them to myself, have they? But to be honest: you look like you're starving. Please, come inside and join me for diner. I was just about to...'\n\n\nSuddenly a pig bumps into her. It then turns to you, shaking it's head violently. Astonished by this sight you fail to produce any comprehensible words. The mysterious woman, straitening her dress, speaks to you again:' Please forgive me, but one of my pigs must have escaped it's pen. Would you like him for dinner tonight? As I was saying, I would love to share my food with you, please do join me at my table.

The marble columns that support the roof are chiseled in a way that makes them look like they are revolving around their own axis, grape branches have winded themselves around their tops. A giant loom is tucked away in a corner.\n\n\nCirce speaks amiably to your crew men, speaking to each of them with civility, listening attentively to their every word en laugh at every joke. It seems your men have a great time. Yet you are not as talkative as you usually are, and the delicious food just barely registers in your mouth. Seeing such kindness and joy you realize just how far you are away from your family and friends in Athens. With a sigh you remember every single face and every single smile. And now you are here, who knows how far away from your home, traveling on some journey given to you by either the gods of figments of your delusional mind, as for that you still aren't certain. Even more depressing is the fact that there is a very real possibility that you will never see your beloved ones again.\n\n\nYou hardly notice the soft hand Circe puts on your shoulder. 'My dear guest, I can see that something is bothering you. Is there any way I can help you?'\n\n\nYou try to turn your face away from hers. 'My graceful hostess, I am sorry. Here, in your warm house I realize how much I miss my beloved ones. Far away I have traveled from them and I scarcely said goodbye to them. And now, I don't know, I am just a little bit depressed.'\n\n\nShe answers you with a kind smile, looking absent, as if gazing at something far away in the distance: 'My dear guest I know how you feel. My family is far away from here as well and the man who I loved most in the whole world has left me long ago. You kind of remind me of him. He too was a traveler, far away from his home after he got lost at sea. The god Poseidon cursed him and he and his men arrived at my island. They stayed for a year, but then they left again, taking my heart with them.' she shakes her head as if to bring herself back into the present, 'but now is not the time for sad reminiscence, let us drink and be merry and forget our troubles for a while. Here, let me refill your cup with this exquisite wine, it's almost magical.'\n\n\nShe pours a deep red wine into your cup. Trying to forget your sad thoughts you taste it. It is the sweetest, most delicious drink you have ever tasted. Like the honey that is made painstakingly by the smallest bees and is the sweetest thing known in the Greek world, and when one eats it one cannot but forget his troubles for a brief while. Even that cannot match the wine you are tasting right now. You quickly drain the cup.\n\n\nThe wine leaves the faint taste of herbs in your mouth and a drowsy feeling in your head. Your eyelids are becoming increasingly heavy and you feel your head drop. As you look across the table you can see the same thing happening to your men. As you look to her to ask for an explanation you see her grabbing a wand from a dresser. She can see your question in your eyes and she answers you with her sweet voice: 'But you won't leave me. You will stay here, with me, until the end of times, just like all other travelers that have come here since my love left me. But to make sure you won't escape I have to may a few arrangements.'\n\n\nShe gracefully walks towards you. You try to back away, but your limbs won't listen to the signals from your brains. She lifts her wand menacingly and you close your eyes. The pain you are expecting stays away and you only feel the gentle tap of Circe's wand upon your head. As you open your eyes with relieve you notice that something is wrong. You see your hands turn into hoofs before your eyes and a snout sprouts where your nose used to be. You fall of your chair, on all four of your legs. You are only able to make grunting sounds as you try to shout to your men.\n\n\nThe last thing you are able to register with your human mind are the kind words of Circe: 'Come, come little piglet.

When she asks you with a sad face if you could at least tell your other men about the dinner you promise her you will. As you walk back across the marble steps you spot docile lions and pigs in their respective pens. Something about the way they look at you doesn't feel right either. Their looks are not those of wild animals, on the contrary they almost look... human.\n\n\nYou neither saw nor heard him approach you but you suddenly feel a hand tapping you gently on your shoulder. As you turn you see the youthful face of Hermes, the keen-eyed messenger of the gods. 'Strange, aren't they, they have the appearance of animals yet they also seem human. Yet neither the one, nor the other. I can see you have questions and the gods have sent me to answer them.'\n\n\nYou don't know where to start and you ask him quickly, as if he'll withdraw his statement if you don't ask something quickly enough: 'Why are we here?'\n\n\n'The gods are testing you.'\n\n\n'Athena gave me a warning about a woman named Circe, was that her?'\n\n\n'Yes, Circe is a witch, she bewitches men with herbs and magic spells. Hear my words and heed them well: these animals you see before you weren't always animals. They were men who were stranded on Circe's island, castaways, merchants, anyone unlucky enough to set foot here is turned into an animal.'\n\n\n'What about my men?'\n\n\n'They too, will be enchanted, cursed to walk the earth as an animal until time itself seizes to exist.'\n\n\n'Isn't there anything I can do to stop her?'\n\n\n'There is a way. Circe bewitches men with the help of magical herbs. However, there is a way to make you immune to her vile witchcraft. Close your eyes.'\n\n\nAs soon as you close your eyes you feel the gentle touch of Hermes' staff on your forehead. Images of a strange plant float into your mind. It's flowers are white, yet it's roots are black and it's leaves are green, with small white stripes running across the length. You want to open your eyes to ask Hermes what kind of herb he is showing you but you cannot manage to open them.\n\n\nYou hear Hermes' soft voice, yet you could swear your ears don't register a thing: 'the herb you see is known by the gods as 'Moly', a powerful herb that counteracts any harmful effects done to the one who eats it. However, anyone who tries to pick them without the permission of the immortal gods will die on the very spot. Use it to stop Circe and rescue your friends, but remember: don't lose sight of your objective.'\n\n\nSilence falls after he spoke these words and after a minute or so you find you can once again open your eyes. The marble step upon which Hermes was standing a moment ago is now empty, bearing no trace or evidence that it was just treaded upon by a deity.\n\n\nRemembering Hermes' words you spend the next hour searching the island for this so called Moly.", "action_results": [{"action": "As you finally find the herb you quickly ingest it and make your way to Circe's mansion.", "result": "The scene you witness as you enter Circe's dining hall is... weird to say the least.

In the middle of the circle burns a great fire that fills the room with a warm glow.\n\n\nThe strange thing, however, is that Circe is sitting all alone at one of the dinner tables, surrounded by a herd of pigs. Half emptied plates and spilled cups of wine diminish the otherwise superb setting.  You approach her as if you are unaware of her malignant intentions. 'My graceful hostess, I hope I am not too late to attend to your dinner. I am feeling better after a quick rest and I would hate to leave without seeing you again. The rest of my men are tending to chores on board of my ship but they will join us in a while.'\n\n\nShe looks at you suspiciously, trying to gauge your intention, but you manage to fool her. 'Very well my noble guest, please join me at my table. Your companions are resting upstairs, I'm afraid that they have eaten a little but too much. but who can blame them, the food is delicious. Please, try some, I'll fill a plate for you if it pleases you. But first, let us drink to your health.'\n\n\nShe gives you a cup of wine. You accept it gracefully, acting as if you didn't catch her sly smile. As you raise your glass you proclaim: 'And to your health as well, fair hostess, that we may drink to your good intentions.'\n\n\nAfter these words you drain your cup. The wine is the sweetest, most delicious drink you have ever tasted. The honey that is made painstakingly by the smallest bees and is the sweetest thing known in the Greek world, and when one eats it one cannot but forget his troubles for a brief while. Even that cannot match the wine you are tasting right now. However, the sweetness of the wine cannot completely hide the taste of unknown herbs.\n\n\nCirce speaks to you with a sweet voice: 'Do you like the wine, my noble guest? Isn't it the sweetest thing you have ever tasted? I keep it specifically for my most valued guests. Too bad though that it bewitches the senses, making one unable to fight off the winged sleep. Unable to defend oneself.'\n\n\nShe rises from her seat and walks towards you, holding a wooden wand in her hand. She taps your head gently with her wand and backs away, awaiting the effects of her magic powers. When nothing happens she raises her hands to the heavens and speaks to you in an astonished voice: 'How is this possible? Why are you still a human?' she suddenly stops speaking, you can see comprehension in her eyes,'of course I should have known, it's HIM all over again.'\n\n\nWhen you try to ask her who she means she interrupts you, paying no attention to your presence whatsoever she continues her furious contemplation: 'A whole year he and his men stayed at my house. A whole year he passed with me, but he had to leave because he missed his home and his wife! His MORTAL wife! I would have given him anything, I would have even made him immortal! But he left me, taking my heart with him.'\n\n\nWhen you once more try to ask who she is talking about she sneers at you: 'Like you don't know him: that Ithacan, who stranded here when he sailed from Troy. The one cursed by the earthshaking Poseidon.' She bursts into tears. 'But you remind me of him, yes, you even look a but like him.'\n\n\nShe walks towards you, having a strange look in your eyes. You quickly stand up from your seat and walk away from her, keeping her inside your vision at all times. Circe extends her arms towards you. 'Please noble hero, please let me embrace you.

As the sun gives way to the starry night sky you curl up on your sleeping mat, feeling the emptiness of the ship pressing on your shoulders. Your dreams are troubled. Images of the events of the past day are flashing through your mind, bringing guilt along with them. The golden glow of a divine presence this time does not relieve you of your troubled thoughts. The angry image of the cloudgatherer Zeus pops into your mind. A crown made of lightning bolts rests upon his grey hair, twisting and contorting as a nest of angry snakes.\n\n\n'Cowardly bard, despicable craven, shame of Athens.

Although, to be honest: I like them more as pigs.'\n\n\nThe next half hour she goes through the big hall, tapping each and every pig on their heads with her wand and muttering incantations. Finally, all your companions are returned to their original selves. Afterwards, Circe approaches you.

'Noble bard, the immortal gods have sent me to bring you a message. You must continue your journey to Sparta or Greece will be destroyed by the flames of war. I advice you to do as they say.'\n\n\nYou look to Circe, ready to say goodbye, but when you see her sad but beautiful face you hesitate.

Eating them will have dire consequences.'\n\n\nBut despite your attempts, the crew doesn't listen, your pleas get lost in the sea of gleaful shouts from the crew. Their ears plugged by hunger and thirst they slaughter the first oxen that catches their view, hardly taking time to roast the meat they gorge themselves, slaughtering even more oxen as their stomachs command them to. You despairingly gaze at this scene, fearing that this means the end of your journey, and possibly of your lives.\n\n\nCyrus approaches you, his chin gleaming with fat.

Your attention is caught by a brightly shining star.

It's almost as if you can feel the heat coming off of it.\n\n\nWhen the truth about this star finally hits you it's already too late.
