I can do whatever I want,\" you reply.\n\n\u201cWhat if the King finds out?\u201d\n\n\u201cHa! So what? I\u2019ll deal with him. There\u2019s not much he can do to me that he hasn't tried before.\u201d\n\n\"It\u2019s not you I\u2019m worried about...\u201d\n\nThough you wouldn\u2019t admit it out loud, you know Harlan is right. Being the second-born prince of the Brelia Kingdom had its benefits. Unfortunately for Harlan, he wasn't afforded the same privilege and would likely be punished much more severely.\n\nYou both sat at the bar in one of the city\u2019s shadiest taverns, The Dancing Goat. Lately, you've become somewhat of a regular. You always wore rugged attire, but its patrons somehow assumed you were nobility, probably because you never argued on price like most everyone else. Once a week, The Goat held fights and it wasn't uncommon for the matches to end in death. After weeks of being thoroughly entertained in the crowd, you were ready to test yourself in the ring.\n\n\u201cHey, pretty boy. Are you ready to pop your cherry?\u201d the announcer\u2019s ragged voice resonates over the bar noise.\n\nYou empty your cups contents.\n\n\u201cIf you have anyone skilled enough to challenge me.\u201d\n\n\"The brash ignorance of youth!\" the announcer replies. \"You're not the first soft face to wander in here. Most don't leave as pretty as they come in.\"\n\n\"I intend to stay this good-looking for awhile, old man,\" you reply.\n\nA burly hand grabs your arm and drags you into the circle of a screaming mob. Looking around, you see the drunken faces of screaming gamblers. Standing your opposite and a full head higher, you instantly recognize your opponent. That\u2019s the fucking champion, you think to yourself. His heavily muscled frame is marked with numerous scars. His eyes meet yours and upon sizing you up, the corner of his lip curls into a grin.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen! Our very own nobleman has finally grown a pair. I just hope he remembered to clean his fingernails for the occasion (the crowd laughs). Who will welcome him to the pit? A man that needs no introduction. A man that has never been defeated. The champion, Carthus!\"\n\nAt the mention of his name, Carthus lets loose a primal scream and beats his chest in pride. The crowd roars into a frenzy at the sight of the monstrous champion.\n\n\u201cFight!\u201d\n\nCarthus rushes at you like a crazed bull. You're unsuprised by his tactics and quickly get a feel for the man's combat prowess. An untrained man of his size, he depends upon superior strength to compensate for lack of technique. You easily side step his mad charge, tagging him with a right hook on the way past. Angered by the blow, Carthus turns to you and starts a second charge.\n\nYou stand still until he\u2019s almost upon you. Just before he reaches you, your arm underhooks his shoulder and you use his momentum to swing onto his back. You throw hard elbows to the back of his head to soften him up a bit. Dazed by your blows, you slip your arm underneath his chin and lock the choke with both arms. He bucks and grabs at you with both hands in attempt to throw you off. Holding with all your strength, you press your body into his and wrap your legs around his massive frame to keep your center of gravity even with his.\n\n\u201cArghh!\u201d you yell as Carthus bucks and flails around the ring.\n\nAfter a few moments, the lack of air gets to him and you feel his body begin to go limp. His body falls to the ground with an earth-shaking thud. You're careful not to be squished by the falling giant.\n\n\u201cVictory! Nobleman!\u201d\n\n\u201cPour me another drink and bring on the next challenger!\u201d you shout to the cheering crowd.", "action_results": [{"action": "The Next Morning", "result": "You feel the events of last night as you wake up. The massive bed, filled with pillows and silk sheets, offers little relief to your pulsing headache. Natalie sure as hell enjoys it though. You didn\u2019t exactly plan for things with the house-servant to escalate this far. The two of you were childhood friends ever since her mother became a handmaiden to your mother, Queen Laurine.\n\n\u201cNat,\u201d you gently nudge her awake. \u201cThink you could scoot over a bit to give me more blanket?\u201d\n\nWith a soft moan she shifts her weight, loosening slack on the covers. She finishes the movement by pressing her bare skin against yours. Overwhelmed by her soft skin and aroma, you briefly forget about your headache and parched throat. Just as you make your move, someone knocks on the door. You ignore it, but another knock echoes in the room. Cursing, you grab a robe from the floor and make your way to the bedroom door. The morning coolness stings your bare feet on the marble floor. Sunlight shining through the sheer, satin drapes reminds you again of the headache. Creaking the door open, you see one of the house servants.\n\n\u201cSamuel, what are you doing here?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cPrince, you are required in the court,\u201d he replies.\n\n\u201cWhat do they want? They rarely ask for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot sure, prince. It sounds important though. All the upper nobility are there including Baron Reginald and Duke Kane.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine. Inform them I'll be there shortly.\u201d\n\nWith a nod, Samuel turns and walks down the hall. You slam the door shut, completely waking Natalie up in the process.\n\n\u201cWhat \u2014 you\u2019re already leaving me?\u201d she playfully whines.\n\n\u201cSorry, Nat. It's a shame their precious first-born, Urijah, is away otherwise they\u2019d summon him instead. It must be important if they\u2019re not willing to wait for his return.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell don\u2019t take too long. You and I have unfinished business here.\u201d\n\nFully exposing herself, she slides out from beneath the covers. Her hair length is almost enough to conceal her chest. You smile, thankful it wasn't grown out more.\n\n\u201cYou must be on guard when approaching the court.\u201d she warns gliding closer towards you. \u201cDangerous people seek to occupy places of power.\u201d\n\nWith her final word she reaches for a dagger on the nightstand. The blade makes a shrill sound as its razor sharp edge is revealed. In a quick motion, she thrusts the point towards your throat. Despite your poor condition, instinct takes over. Ducking from the thrust, you grab her hand around the hilt and twist backwards, forcing the dagger from her hand and pinning her against the wall.\n\n\u201cDangerous people are everywhere,\u201d you whisper from behind.", "action_results": [{"action": "The Royal Court", "result": "A little later you make your way to the throne room. Hopefully Nat's distraction didn't make you too late. You swing open the heavy double doors and instantly see Queen Laurine's scowl upon your tardiness.

In the front row you eye the backs of Duke Kane and Baron Reginald. Both held incredible military might and seemingly endless wealth. It's no surprise they have the best seats as both were instrumental in the growth and defense of the kingdom.\n\nDuke Kane's Order of Knights were the best trained warriors in Brelia. More than a few times, King Orson called upon them to protect the kingdom. As far as you knew, the Duke was loyal to the throne. His son, Garrick, was highly regarded for his weapon mastery and dueling ability.\n\nBaron Reginald was more of a loose cannon. His background in politics and trade meant he relied upon his guile rather than raw physical strength. The Baron was a well-informed man. Nothing stayed a secret from him long. For that reason, you\u2019ve always kept a safe distance away from his daughter, Caitlyn.\n\n\u201c...they have grown too bold. We must show them the military might of Brelia!\u201d the baron's voice rings out over the crowd.\n\n\u201cNonsense Reginald,\" Duke Kane interjects. \"Moving soldiers near to the border would look like an invasion force on Rath. We have been at peace for a decade now. We don\u2019t need to give them cause for another war. Besides, Prince Urijah is on a diplomatic mission in Rath. We risk losing the heir to the throne if we assemble soldiers near the border.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just allow our villages to burn! My King, we must act!\u201d the Baron replies heated.\n\nKing Orson holds a hand up, silencing the crowd from growing louder. He stands from the throne and paces a few times back and forth as if in an internal debate. His fingers find his lengthy beard in thought. After a few moments, he looks up and addresses the court.\n\n\u201cWe must not act in a way that would appear aggressive to the Nation of Rath,\" he speaks. \"Many of our countrymen died in the war and I would not dare compromise their sacrifice\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014but my King!\u201d Baron Reginald interjects.\n\nOrson silences him with another wave of his hand.\n\n\u201cYour King is speaking.

I will send a small company of soldiers led by my own son to discover the threat at our borders. I will not put the heir in danger by sending a full battalion. My second born will scout and report back. Then we will decide the best course of action. If Rath has betrayed our peace treaty, then they will face the full might of Brelia. My son, step forward.\u201d\n\nShaken by the King\u2019s command, you rise from your chair and walk towards the front of the room. At this point, every eye in the room is fixed upon you.\n\n\u201cMy son. You have heard the trial placed before you. Along with a few of my elite soldiers, you will travel to the western border and discover the source of these attacks. I am taking a risk sending the second born while the heir is on a diplomatic mission, but there is no one I trust greater to accomplish this task. I will not be the only parent taking such a risk.

Even more so when you imagine the warmth of Natalie in your bed. The soldiers ride stoic and alert, not telling jokes or sharing stories. Talking is kept at a minimum to limit distraction from potential threats.\n\nThe soldiers, donned with light leather armor, carry a variety of weapons between them. Each has a melee and ranged weapon. Some have bows strung over their shoulder with small bucklers on their back. Others carry throwing spears to compliment their battle axes.

There isn't much you remember of your childhood beyond the endless hours training with the weapon masters. They made sure you mastered every weapon, to always be deadly and effective no matter the circumstance. Complimentary to the physical training, your father brought in sages to teach history and battle tactics to train the mind as well as the body.\n\nYou have a long journey ahead of you.

So why the fuck would you try to pull rank like that? The King knows that you aren\u2019t interested in leading our people. Your consistent belligerent actions speak for themselves. You\u2019ve never experienced discipline or tested your willpower like I have. Since I could walk, my father trained me personally and recruited the best instructors in the kingdom to mold me into the knight that I am today. I have never been bested in a duel and the King knows my worth. Surely, he knows that I am more valuable to the kingdom than your sorry ass.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose are bold words coming from an esteemed musician such as yourself. I\u2019ll let it slide this time because I was having fun with you, but if you ever threaten me again you\u2019ll have to rethink your title of 'Undefeated Duelist'. You think just because I don\u2019t act uptight and walk around with a stick up my ass my life was any easier? Maybe my light demeanor and tendency to drink is because I understand life is more than training and stern lectures.

Inside, paper-pushers and scribes silently work while politicians clamor in heated debates. The arguments of frail old men lead to the death of young men, you think to yourself.

Despite the risk, there are benefits to being close to another nation. Namely, trade. We import a large number of goods from Rath as I\u2019m sure your aware. Although these may be strenuous times, being the war and all, I find that trading and dealing is how you create ally from enemy. If you prove that you can work together with a simple transaction, you create the opportunity for more mutually beneficial deals.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt certainly has a unique flavor\u2026 leaves quite a burning sensation.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay what you will about the Rathan people, they embrace the hard parts about life.\u201d\n\nGarrick steps forward to speak, \u201cGovernor Lucius, I was unaware you hired outside security.\u201d Eyeing the poleaxes he adds, \u201cWasn\u2019t it only last summer that the King ordered a large number of my father\u2019s knights to increase the defense of Nastela?

Straight to the matter at hand then\u2026 I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about the recent raids that have been targeting small villages along the border? Of course you have, that\u2019s why you\u2019re here. Well I can assure you, no Rathan raiders are making it through my city. Not a single person comes or goes without my knowledge, certainly not entire raiding parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat did not answer my question, Governor,\u201d Garrick answers narrowing his eyes.\n\n\u201cI suppose we were going to find ourselves here one way or another,\u201d Lucius muses. \u201cNow!\u201d\n\nAt his signal, the guardsmen in unison move into battle position. The clanking of armor echoes throughout the room as the heavily armed soldiers encircle your company.\n\n\u201cTreasonous bastard!\u201d Garrick shouts and charges the governor.\n\nLucius\u2019 attention goes back to the scroll as he murmurs the remaining incantation of the spell. With his final word, Lucius vanishes and a blast of energy fills the room knocking Garrick off his feet. Papers fly aimlessly as the occupants of the room try to reorient themselves. Will and his fellow soldiers engage the governor\u2019s guard. Their light leather armor offers little protection against the sheer might and brutality of the heavy poleaxes. They fight expertly, but circumstances are against them. Into the fray you join as more guards pour into the room. You begin to notice your sword hand growing heavy, each parry becoming more sluggish. Your eye catches a goblet on the floor. Drugged, you surmise. In the corner of your eye, you see Caitlyn has come to the same conclusion. She nimbly dodges several attacks before getting tagged by an iron gauntlet to the mouth. One by one, each of your soldiers are cut down. This is not how I imagined the end would come, you think just before your world turns black.", "action_results": [{"action": "Awaken", "result": "Your vision is a blur as you slip in and out of consciousness. They are transporting you somewhere, but your mind is too hazy to comprehend where exactly. You hear waves. The clasp of iron is heard distinctly through the background noise of bodies shuffling and a man yelling orders. You feel the the ground beneath you unsteady. They are transporting you by sea. You are unsure how many days it\u2019s been since the encounter at Nastela. Your head is throbbing and you don\u2019t know whether anyone from your company is still alive. A black hood is placed over your head preventing you from seeing your surroundings. Yep, definitely not how I thought that day would go, you think. You take some comfort in remembering that Cait was knocked out instead of killed. Maybe she\u2019s on the ship with you.\n\n\u201cCaitlyn!\u201d you shout and promptly get backhanded.\n\n\u201cPrince?\u201d You hear the soft spoken voice of a female somewhere to your right. Then another smack fills the air.\n\n\u201cNo talking,\u201d a grizzly voice bellows.\n\nHours later, the ship makes port. You feel the tug of your chains lead you from the boat into the back of a caravan. The hood is still over your head, but you can feel the hot, dry air of the environment. The ground beneath you is too loose to be dirt. It\u2019s sand. Traveling over what you guess are cobblestones, the bumpy caravan takes you into a city.\n\n\u201cOut,\u201d the same voice commands.\n\nWaiting for the man chained in front, you climb out and stand in line at your captor\u2019s direction. The hood is pulled from your head blinding your eyes in the sudden sunlight. Once you finally adjust to the light, you see a large dark skinned man standing in front of you. He\u2019s holding a whip in his right hand and a wicked-looking scimitar in the other.\n\n\u201cYou are property of Lady Myrr. Whatever she wishes, you will do. If you disobey her, you will be punished. If you insult her name, you will be punished. If you even fucking look at her wrong\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be punished?\u201d\n\nChained a few bodies down from you, Caitlyn speaks out of turn.\n\nThe dark skinned man, Darius, walks up to her glaring into her eyes in evaluation.\n\n\u201cIt is unwise to speak over the man who holds your life in his hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought Lady Myrr owns me. Not you,\u201d Caitlyn retorts.\n\nDespite the truth of her words, she is met with a punch to the gut and doubles over in pain.\n\n\u201cLady Myrr owns your miserable lives and I am the instrument in which she commands! I am the one who will ensure you serve the Lady. Trouble makers and insurrectionists will meet unimaginable pain before leaving this world. Now walk.\u201d\n\nFor emphasis, Darius cracks the whip at the ground close to where Caitlyn is kneeling. He leads the group of chained prisoners through a courtyard, down several staircases, and into the dungeon. Torches hanging upon the dimly lit hallways are the only source of light. The prisoners are divided three into a cell. Unfortunately, you aren\u2019t placed with Caitlyn. You wonder what happened to Garrick. You didn\u2019t see him among the others. You aren\u2019t even sure if he\u2019s alive. Out of the two other prisoners in your cell, only one looks like a fighter. His long unkempt hair hangs to his mid back and his beard is just as long.

There has never been an established government on this island because the pirate lords have always overthrown whoever tried colonizing it. Doesn\u2019t matter which major superpower tries: Rath, The Jeika Dominion, even the Kingdom of Brelia hasn\u2019t been able to control Miranna.

Why hasn\u2019t some bad mother fucker with a giant hat and peg leg taken charge?\u201d you question.\n\n\u201cAh you mean Captain Myrr. Yeah, he used to be in charge. Before the Lady slit his throat in front of his crew, that is. She may be pretty looking and lady-like, but she\u2019s bat-shit crazy. Don\u2019t let her polite manners fool you. She\u2019s a devil. She was royalty in some faraway land before getting kidnapped and sold by her usurping uncle. She spent years as a slave doing god knows what before catching the attention of a certain pirate lord. She\u2019s a dangerous mix of noble intelligence and slave ruthlessness.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe does sound the intriguing character.\u201d you say. \u201cI think I\u2019d very much like to meet the Lady.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour funeral.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "Sleep", "result": "You awaken to the splash of cold water hitting your face.\n\n\u201cFuck!\u201d you shout.\n\n\u201cRise and shine, scum,\u201d Darius answers with a cruel grin.\n\nSeveral armed guards pull you from your cell and march you and the other prisoners from the dungeon. They lead you into an open, sandy area surrounded by a massive wall. Guards with spears and bows patrol the top of the wall limiting any sort of escape.

You instantly recognize Lady Myrr. Her raven colored dress hugs tightly against her, leaving no wonder to the curve of her body. Her pure black hair would be lost in the silky shadow of her dress if not for the exposed back.\n\n\u201cJust the usual shit,\u201d Darius replies. \u201cPerhaps we should give them the opportunity to show their value. Does the Lady desire a demonstration?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet them prove their worth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou heard the Lady. Swords!\u201d Darius shouts.\n\nWhile slaves rushed to follow Darius\u2019 orders, guards carefully unchained the prisoners and warned against any revolt upon penalty of death. Expecting wooden training swords, you were surprised when real steel was placed in your hand. At random you were separated into two lines facing one another. Luckily, you are on the same side as Caitlyn. One line was given red ribbons to wear signifying which \"team\" they\u2019re on.\n\n\u201cI can imagine you dumb goat fuckers need instructions, even though it should be fairly obvious!\u201d Darius yells. \u201cLast team standing wins. By any means necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do we win?\u201d you can\u2019t help but ask.\n\nAngry that he\u2019s interrupted, Darius gives you a look and continues, \u201cProve your worth to Lady Myrr! Oh and the winner will receive a full wine skin courtesy of the generous Lady Myrr.\u201d\n\nDarius cracks his whip signaling to start. The two groups of slaves rush towards each other clashing with the ring of steel and barbaric screams. Men cry out in anguish as blades find their way into unprotected flesh. The white sand is dyed red as each man falls. You almost feel bad about cutting down the ill-trained slaves, but you remind yourself that they\u2019d kill you if they could. Each swing of your blade causes destruction. The strength and quickness of your strikes easily passes through the feeble defenses you encounter. Only a few manage a single parry before you rip them apart. Your group wins easily, only losing a couple of lives in the process.\n\n\u201cGive them their wine.

Entering into the room, Lady Myrr gracefully rises from her chair and strides in your direction.\n\n\u201cNow what am I to think when I see one of my prisoners cut down multiple men without breaking a sweat?\u201d Lady Myrr asks pouring two glasses of wine from a jewel-covered pitcher. \"Guards, leave us.\"\n\n\u201cTempt a man with a good drink and the company of a beautiful woman and he\u2019ll accomplish anything,\u201d you respond.\n\n\u201cHeh, I don\u2019t remember ever offering to meet with the victors of that fun little game.\u201d\n\n\u201c Let's just say I had a feeling you'd want to meet the one who distinguished themselves above the rest.

She had been given some training as a girl, but nothing extensive. She was not unskilled, simply lacked proper refinement. Her determination to perfectly perform drills surprised you. You imagined someone with her status would only order people around. Lady Myrr takes a more hands on approach. On more than one occasion, she would not continue the lesson until the specific form was mastered. Luckily, she didn\u2019t pry deeper into your past. You aren\u2019t quite sure what would happen if she found out who you are and you really didn\u2019t want to find out. No, you felt it was best to hide your identity.\n\n\u201cFucking hell! I always drop my guard when attempting that feint.\u201d Myrr shouts in frustration.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re overcompensating with your leg power. It should be quick, without effort. Like this.\u201d\n\nYou perform the technique to perfection as you\u2019ve done countless times.\n\n\u201cShow off. Alright that\u2019s enough for today. I need you for something,\u201d Lady Myrr says.\n\n\u201cSomething else than training?\u201d you question.\n\n\u201cYes. Darius should be here any moment. Ah here he is.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lady Myrr,\u201d Darius bows. \u201cSlave,\u201d he mentions with obvious distaste in your direction.\n\n\u201cSpeak freely,\u201d Lady Myrr commands.\n\n\u201cOur contacts have reported Captain Kano is plotting with the Rathans against you,\" Darius says. \"They will aid him with firepower as long as he remains loyal to Rath.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre these contacts to be trusted?\u201d Lady Myrr asks.\n\n\u201cI trust them with my life, my Lady.

You would ask his advice when your entire manor is threatened?\u201d Darius interjects.\n\nBefore Darius could think to react, Lady Myrr grabs his throat and trips him to the ground. Her vise-like grip prevents any air from his breath, her knee holding his body in place on the ground. Judging by his size, you don\u2019t doubt that Darius could overpower the Lady off him if he really wanted to, but he continues to lay in obedience. You stand ready just in case.\n\n\u201cYOU will fucking listen to ME. If I ask your opinion, I want to hear it. Don\u2019t presume that I want to hear it all the time.

You have been granted the privilege of walking freely within my walls because you have shown you\u2019re not a common slave. I have spent enough time with you to know you\u2019re not stupid enough to attempt escape. This will be different. You will be beyond these walls, armed, and without guards. You have served me faithfully, even being enjoyable company. Before you get any ideas, know that should you betray me or this mission, you will be executed. You have spent enough time around here to know that would not be a quick process. I may value you, but the smallest hint of disobedience will be punished severely.\u201d\n\n\u201cLady, I like my limbs attached and throat un-slit. You have nothing to worry about,\u201d you reply.

Lady Myrr does the same beside you. It wasn\u2019t the first time it happened during your months of training. Still, it complicated things a bit. You figured you didn\u2019t have a choice in the matter. Lady Myrr always gets her way and this wasn\u2019t exactly a difficult order to follow. The refusal of her advances would cause more problems, and even possibly your life. You felt a pang of guilt each time for Natalie\u2019s sake, but you couldn\u2019t help wanting more. She curls up next to you and gently runs her hand over your bare skin.\n\n\u201cYou know many men would kill for the position you have now,\u201d she breaks the silence.\n\n\u201cI doubt anyone would kill to put themselves into slavery.\u201d\n\n\u201cBesides that. You know what I mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know and I can\u2019t blame them. You\u2019re beautiful. Everyone at their very core desires someone to be intimate with. Someone who they can share their inner secrets to without fear of judgment or rejection. The luckiest people are the ones who find that early in their lifetime.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince you\u2019ve arrived here, I\u2019ve never heard you speak in such a way. Perhaps there is more to you than base animal instinct.\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, thanks?\u201d\n\n\u201cTake it as a good thing. There is more to life than drinking and fucking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ironic,\u201d you say, pouring another cup of wine.\n\n\u201cPeople in my position don\u2019t last long. The power hungry always desire to move up. It\u2019s their nature. Every captain on this fucking island wants my head. Captain Kano is just the one foolish enough to try.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be foolish to try on his own at least, but he partnered with a strong ally. He\u2019s not as foolish as you think.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck Captain Kano. He\u2019s a soft cocked puppet. Tomorrow I\u2019ll slit his throat myself and put his head on a pike to welcome his Rathan allies.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re joining the raid personally?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! On this island, respect is earned. Fear works the same way. Either by respect or fear, they\u2019ll all fall in line.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever it takes, I guess. Might I make a request?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot this again\u2026 some girls may find pleasure there, but I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not that. Although we can revisit that conversation another time. I was talking about the raid. There is a prisoner that was transported with me. Caitlyn. She is deadly with a pair of daggers. Our success chances would greatly increase if she were accompany us. We were childhood friends. I\u2019m sure you remember her from the \u2018game\u2019 we played.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2026 her. She was quite skilled. If she were any better, she might be the one laying next to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, that\u2019s not a bad idea\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t push your luck,\" Lady Myrr says. \"Very well, I\u2019ll order Darius to bring her. Any attempt to escape by either of you will have fatal consequences. If even one of you runs, I\u2019ll kill the other without hesitation. I don\u2019t care that we\u2019ve shared the same bed. Your fate will be the same as any disobedient slave.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do love your dirty talk,\u201d you reply.\n\n\u201cProve it to me.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "The Raid", "result": "You creep quietly among the outskirts of Captain Kano\u2019s villa. From your vantage point, you see several patrol units on the perimeter. From a few open windows, it doesn\u2019t look to be that heavily guarded on the inside. To the east of the villa you see his sloop, The Boar, docked with members of his crew playing dice and drinking outside. Lady Myrr leads the raid group. There were only ten of you total, way less numbers than you expected. When you brought it up she simply said, We will create more fear if Kano disappears during the night. The others will not sleep as easy.\n\nLady Myrr whispers her commands, \u201cWe\u2019ll split into two groups. Darius\u2019 will strike near The Boar cutting off reinforcements and my group will sneak into the villa, find Kano, and end his life. Once you see the building burning, we\u2019ll meet back at the manor. Kill anyone who gets in your way.\u201d\n\nEveryone nods in agreement. Unsurprisingly, Myrr puts you in her group. You are a little disappointed when Caitlyn is put in the other, especially since Darius was in charge. At first you\u2019re afraid his hatred of you will cause problems for Caitlyn, but then you remember he hates her too. Myrr silently leads the way towards the villa. Staying in the high grass, you use the cover of night to sneak past the patrols undetected. One unlucky pirate chooses a spot near you to relieve himself. Lady Myrr takes advantage of his vulnerable position and greets him with knife to the throat.\n\nYour group reaches the villa with no other encounters. The inside is filled with mahogany furniture and oil paintings. You move stealthily through the hallways. Internally you comment on the decor, Captain Kano sure is a lavish man. Hmm, I would have assumed a pirate captain\u2019s villa to be, well, more rambunctious, you think. It\u2019s quiet. Too quiet\u2026 A whirling sound fills the air. Led by your acute senses, your blade automatically moves into a defensive position blocking the projectile that was aimed at your heart.\n\n\u201cAmbush!\u201d you yell.\n\nSeveral doors in the hallway swing open and men rush out with their scimitars and sabres raised high. You meet the first attacker, parrying his blade before countering with a deadly blow to the gut. The second doesn\u2019t even get a chance to swing before your lighting thrust drops him. The narrow corridor allows your group to fight a few at a time, but each kill is replaced with another fresh body.\n\nFighting with her back to yours, Lady Myrr shouts, \u201cShow yourself, coward! I know you\u2019re here!\u201d\n\n\u201cHalt your advance!\u201d a voice cries amidst the fighting.\n\nThe pirates halt their attack and stand aside for their captain. Kano, you presume, strides forward. His tall frame overshadows his men. His mouth twists into a crooked smile as he takes the pipe from his mouth to speak.\n\n\u201cWell, well. What do we have here? A pirate queen out in the open? So unprotected. So exposed.\u201d Turning to you he adds, \u201cAh, the prince that I\u2019ve heard so much about. You\u2019re a little more baby-faced than I was expecting. The tales of your swordsmanship made me think you were a seasoned man.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrince?\u201d Lady Myrr asks.\n\nIgnoring her and putting the facts together, you reply to Kano.\n\n\u201cI take it you and Governor Lucius have been talking. You are fools if you think aligning with Rath is in your best interest. They\u2019ll turn on you in a second. You think Rath will just let you rule here without oversight? No, they\u2019ll use you for their own gain and toss you aside once they have what they need.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a prince?\u201d Lady Myrr asks again. Captain Kano also ignores her.\n\n\u201cHa-ha-ha! How dumb do you think I am? Miranna will survive as it always has. Rath is only a means to an end. There isn\u2019t a nation that can rule Miranna. Miranna belongs to the free. If Rath decides to dishonor their agreement, they will meet the same end as every invading nation. Our ships will sink any attack force. Neither Rath nor Brelia has a navy that can defeat us. But that is none of your concern. I\u2019m afraid your time is at an end. I would have preferred to ransom you to Orson, but Darius was very adamant about this part of the deal. He even refused a majority share in your would-be ransom. Can you believe that?\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, I can. That guy hates me,\u201d you respond.\n\n\u201cDarius would never\u2014\u201d\n\nLady Myrr starts to speak before Darius enters with a bloodied Caitlyn bound and gagged. He pushes her to the ground in front of you. She looks up to you, eyes watering as if to apologize for getting captured.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my Lady. I believed in you, I really did, but this prince has corrupted your mind and your ideals. I don\u2019t know why you took so much interest in him. It should have been me at your side and yet you cast me aside for what? For an irresponsible fling? I\u2019ve known you long enough to see the way you look at him. Why couldn\u2019t it have been me? I\u2019ve always done everything you\u2019ve asked! Yet you treat me like one of your common slaves. I am more than that. We could have been more than that! Miranna deserves a strong ruler. I\u2019m sorry it had to come to this,\" Darius confesses.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry too,\u201d Lady Myrr speaks softly. Louder she adds, \u201cSorry that I trusted a miscreant like you! The deepest levels of Hell belong to fucking traitors like you. You\u2019re betraying me because I didn\u2019t fuck you? I doubt your small cock would even get close to satisfying me. You\u2019re despicable, you\u2019re a bitch, and I will fucking kill you for this. One by one, I\u2019ll remove your fingernails and then move to the fingers themselves next.

This is all your fault, Prince. Everything was fine before you arrived, although I guess you didn\u2019t really have a choice in that matter. Captain Kano filled me in.

You can save one of your precious ladies here\u2026 you\u2019ll just need to kill the other. You have my word, I\u2019ll spare the one who you don\u2019t execute.

Her eyes flash in anger for a brief moment before resolving in a visionless, peaceful gaze. You cradle her head as she lies dying in your arms. Tears wet your face as you try to comfort her during her last moment. Her hand reaches to touch your cheek before falling limp to the ground. You gently kiss her forehead and close her eyelids.\n\n\u201cAhh, interesting. That just lost me a handful of coins.

Red streaks of blood start to appear at his arms, face, and chest. Seeing blood, Caitlyn attacks quicker and deeper. In a matter of seconds, Darius\u2019 body is a mangled mess of open wounds. He doesn\u2019t even get a chance to curse before choking on his blood. You join the battle alongside your brother, Urijah. The two of you work in unison, attacking while the other is defending and vice versa. You were taught by the same weapon masters and the similarity of your movement is proof. You know what the other is planning and how he will strike.\n\n\u201cCover me, Brother!\u201d\n\nUrijah shouts and pulls at the amulet around his neck. Whispering an incantation, he finishes the final word of power. The entire hallway fills with a blinding light for a moment and then suddenly, the light vanishes, shooting into his floating body.

As always, it looks like you\u2019re caught up in some weird love triangle.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could have saved Lady Myrr.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would I risk saving her?

My task was to meet with their leaders and discuss how we might continue our peace treaty. I never made it that far. When I reached Nastela, I discovered that Governor Lucius was conspiring with the Rathans to overthrow the kingdom. Along with the knights provided by Duke Kane, we attempted to overthrow Lucius. We failed. He hired too many mercs for us to handle. Most of knights were killed and the rest of us were sold to slavers in Miranna. During the slave auction, I happened to spot an assassination attempt on Captain Kano, saving his life. In gratitude, he purchased and gave me the opportunity to work on his ship to pay off the amount he bought me for. I never told them who I was because I figured it\u2019d make things worse, so I\u2019ve just been here, biding my time waiting for a chance to escape. Then I overheard Kano talking about the unsuspecting prince in Lady Myyr\u2019s employ. Knew that had to be you. Luckily, Darius was infatuated with the Lady and I used his jealousy to turn him against her. You really can\u2019t go anywhere without causing drama, huh?

Peasants, merchants, and nobility alike greeted you as heroes. King Orson was so overjoyed in having his two sons back that he threw a feast for the entire city.

If I even make it.\u201d\n\nCaitlyn storms off into the darkness leaving you alone. The grenade in the villa caused a lot of damage. Part of the building is still on fire and you can see crew members rushing around with buckets of water. At least they\u2019ll be distracted. Besides, they won\u2019t expect the person who blew a hole in the wall to sneak back in, you reason. You make it past the scrambling fire fighters and make it to the villa. The inside of the building is a mess. Debris is scattered everywhere. The paintings that you first admired are torn and littered on the floor. Turning the corner, you see a bloodied Lady Myrr strapped to a chair in front of Captain Kano and his crew members.\n\n\u201cHeh, bet you didn\u2019t think your plan would turn out this way. Your attempt failed and your new toy of prince left you here to die. You have nothing left except your life. Which I intend to take shortly,\u201d Kano finishes his taunt with a slap to Lady Myrr\u2019s cheek.\n\n\u201cFinish the deed then, swine,\u201d she spits.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m about to. But it\u2019d be a shame not to take advantage of such a beautiful creature before,\u201d Kano\u2019s says running his hand down the side of her face.\n\nYou burst into the room with a string of curses. Fueled by hate, you draw your sword to run Kano through. You never make it that far. A pistol shot tags your leg collapsing you to the ground. As you\u2019re getting up, another shot hits you in the chest. A wounded Darius emerges from the shadows holding two smoking flintlock pistols. You lay in a pool of your own blood. The last thing you see is a cruel smile upon his face as he walks towards Lady Myrr.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Escape with Caitlyn", "result": "There is no point in going back for Lady Myrr. You doubt she escaped the blast. Hell, you were lucky to even make it out. You and Caitlyn travel off the road to the center hub of Miranna. With an island full of fugitives and outlaws you figure it wouldn\u2019t be that difficult to lay low. Even though it\u2019s night, the place is still alive. The taverns almost never close. You and Caitlyn meander through the streets looking for a place to rest. Her skills must be remarkable because Caitlyn is even able to swipe a few coins from a passing by drunk to pay for the room. On the outskirts of the hub, you find a place: The Cove Inn. The place isn\u2019t rowdy like the others you passed by. A few depressed-looking sailors sit at the bar milking their drinks. You pay for a room, not having to say much to the Innkeeper. The service providers on Miranna didn\u2019t question wounded patrons. As long as they had coin. You help lay Caitlyn down on the bed and take a spot next to her.\n\nThe next morning\u2026\n\nYou awaken with pain everywhere. The adrenaline from the night before had finally worn off. With a grunt you sit up to see how Caitlyn\u2019s doing. Her face is white and the wound at her side looks to be infected.\n\n\u201cShit, Cait. Your side\u2026\u201d your voice trails off.\n\nShe barely manages to speak, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Prince. I let Darius capture me and it\u2019s all my fault. Thank you for saving me. I know you grew close to Lady Myrr.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that. It\u2019s my fault. You\u2019ll be fine. Just need to rest up a bit. I\u2019ll go find us more money to pay for another night,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cEver the fool, Prince. Will you tell my father I fought bravely?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, Cait,\u201d you say tears welling up in your eyes.\n\n\u201cThank you, Prince. I love\u2014\u201d her words cut before she can finish the sentence.\n\nYou press your forehead to hers feeling the weight of your actions. If you hadn\u2019t grown so attached to Lady Myrr, you could have killed her and possibly escaped to Brelia with Caitlyn. Suddenly, you hear heavy footsteps coming from downstairs. You can\u2019t fully hear the conversation with the Innkeeper, but you clearly hear one word in particular: 'Upstairs'. Not taking any chances, you hurriedly put on your sword belt and grab your things. You hesitate, wondering if you shouldn\u2019t leave Caitlyn\u2019s body on the bed. What does it matter at this point? She\u2019s dead and you\u2019ve lost everything. Every move stings as your bruises and open wounds remind you of the night before. It\u2019s not as bad as Cait got, you think. You escape through the window and make your way through the back alley to avoid whoever is downstairs. Out of nowhere, two street thugs appear in front and another two to your back.\n\n\u201cWhat do we have here? A lost nobleman?\u201d the ugly one to your left says. To be fair, they're both ugly.\n\n\u201cWhat? No, why does everyone call me that\u2026 I\u2019m really not in the mood for this,\u201d you reply.\n\nYou try to push past them, but they stop you. Angry at your circumstance, you take it out on the street thugs. Turning on the two behind you first, you whirl around pulling your sword from your belt in one decisive movement. Your sword drives into the gut of one and your fist meets the other\u2019s face. As he\u2019s dazed, you rip your sword out and slice in an upward manner through his throat. You sense the others drawing near and turn to face them. Hindered by your injuries, you parry a few blows before being overtaken by their fury. As you bleed out in the alley, you think of home.

I can\u2019t believe no one\u2019s tried to rule Miranna with help from a major nation. Seems like a good idea,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cOh they\u2019ve tried. The partnership always falls through. It\u2019s hard to keep a solid ally without trust. Ironically, one always ends up betraying the other out of fear of being betrayed,\u201d Lady Myrr answers.\n\n\u201cHas anyone tried to overthrow you since taking power?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cTwo or three.

I need you to fine tune my sword skills before we act,\u201d Myrr says, unsheathing her blade.\n\nLater that week\u2026\n\nYou fall back in your bed exhausted. Lady Myrr does the same beside you. It wasn\u2019t the first time it happened during your months of training. Still, it complicated things a bit. You figured you didn\u2019t have a choice in the matter. Lady Myrr always gets her way and this wasn\u2019t exactly a difficult order to follow. The refusal of her advances would cause more problems, and even possibly your life. You felt a pang of guilt each time for Natalie\u2019s sake, but you couldn\u2019t help wanting more. She curls up next to you and gently runs her hand over your bare skin.\n\n\u201cThat was\u2026 exhilarating,\u201d you break the silence.\n\n\u201cMaybe for you,\u201d Myrr replies.\n\n\u201cYou sure know how to hurt a guy\u2019s feelings.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know how to hurt more than just feelings. Another performance like that and you\u2019ll find out,\u201d Myrr says, holding a straight face.\n\nYou stare in her eyes sensing if she\u2019s messing with you. Finally, she breaks and grins, letting you know she\u2019s joking with a playful grab under the covers. Suddenly, she recoils and clutches at her throat. Her body convulses, and her cough covers you in blood. You look up to see a masked figure dressed in black. You reach for the knife on the nightstand, but you\u2019re too slow. The figure\u2019s broadsword pierces your gut. You stumble out of the bed, tripping and clutching your wound. Naked and unarmed you attempt a feeble punch at the assassin before collapsing.

Brelia and Rath have fought numerous wars since their founding. The two nations occupy most of the land mass in Kria and each is always trying distinguish themselves from the other. The last war, which ended 10 years ago, resulted in a massive wall built by Brelia. The wall stretches across the entire western border to protect against Rathan raiders. The King of Brelia, Orson, decided to build the wall in order to establish peace. The cyclical nature of the Rathan/Brelian wars needed to end, and the only solution in King Orson\u2019s mind was to take preventative measures against rogue raiding parties. Orson has made it his life mission to keep the peace with Rath.\n\nThe people of Brelia view Rath as uncivilized barbarians. Although Rath doesn't possess the technology or engineering of Brelia, the Rathan people are sturdy. The average Rathan stands almost a head taller than the average Brelian. Dust storms and tornadoes plague Rath causing its people to adapt to the harsh environment. For that reason, Rath doesn't have the enormous cities and buildings that Brelia possess.\n\nMiranna is an island of cutthroats, lawlessness, and pirates. The island is north of both Rath and Brelia across the Cutter\u2019s Channel. Many nations have tried to colonize Miranna and establish their rule. All have failed. Miranna is a place of organized chaos where the law is dictated by the strong. Whoever has the most power is in charge. It's not uncommon for the ruling pirate lord to be assassinated in the night by a rival. Merchant and naval ships know to navigate well away from Miranna. Ships that stray too near are pillaged. The crew is either killed or sold. It\u2019s no secret there is tremendous wealth to be earned in Miranna. The opportunities are seemingly endless.

Looking around, you see the drunken faces of screaming gamblers. Standing your opposite and a full head higher, you instantly recognize your opponent. That\u2019s the fucking champion, you think to yourself. His heavily muscled frame is marked with numerous scars. His eyes meet yours and upon sizing you up, the corner of his lip curls into a grin.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen! Our very own nobleman has finally grown a pair.
