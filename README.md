# AIDungeon2

## The model for AI Dungeon2 is temporarily unavailable to download due to cost. We're working on a solution!

Read more about AIDungeon2 and how it was built [here](https://pcc.cs.byu.edu/2019/11/21/ai-dungeon-2-creating-infinitely-generated-text-adventures-with-deep-learning-language-models/).

Play the game in Colab [here](http://www.aidungeon.io).

To play the game locally you need a beefy GPU ~12 GB and CUDA installed.

git clone https://github.com/nickwalton/AIDungeon/
cd AIDungeon

Contributing
------------------------
Contributing to AIDungeon is relatively easy.  Just send us a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) from your fork.
When you send your request, make ``develop`` the destination branch on the
[AIDungeon repository](https://github.com/nickwalton/AIDungeon).

We prefer PRs to be
[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliant.

AIDungeon uses a rough approximation of the
[Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
branching model.  The ``develop`` branch contains the latest
contributions, and ``master`` is always tagged and points to the latest
stable release.
