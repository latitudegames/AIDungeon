The voice of Nicholas's young son, Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich, narrates the
remainder of the story. 1883 Western Siberia,
a young Grigori Rasputin is asked by his father and a group of men to perform magic.
Rasputin has a vision and denounces one of the men as a horse thief. Although his
father initially slaps him for making such an accusation, Rasputin watches as the
man is chased outside and beaten. Twenty years later, Rasputin sees a vision of
the Virgin Mary, prompting him to become a priest. Rasputin quickly becomes famous,
with people, even a bishop, begging for his blessing. <eod> </s> <eos>"""
